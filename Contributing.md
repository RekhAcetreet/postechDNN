* :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
* :bug: `:bug:` when you fixed a bug.
* :rocket: `:rocket:` when you speed up a code via time complexity or code optimization.
* :memo: `:memo:` when you wrote a document.
* :warning: `:warning:` when you reduced the memory usage.
* :lock: `:lock:` when you resolved a securty issue.
* :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when you started new project or add a new feature.
* :beers: `:beers:` when you merged and resolved conflicts.

### Code Style 
Check the [google c++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Document 
Each project must have corresponding README.md that explain the project. See with [ExampleREADME.md](https://github.com/icothos/DNN/ExampleREADME.md)
Your README.md must include following contents.

#### 'PROJECT_NAME'
you type project name in the area

#### 'Paper Information'
When the alogrithm or data structure is implementation of some paper, you type the paper information below way on the area otherwise it makes to empty part.
Papername : author [year]

#### What is 'PROJECT_NAME'
Overall examplenation of the project

#### Before Use It 

### Setup the Project
Basically we use naive c++ code, but some applications and hueristic algorithms might be implemented using different environment. 
### Dependent Project
