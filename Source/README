Introduction 
------------
DNN is a library for nearest neighbor algorithms and their applications. 
Main purpose of this library is to support nearest neighbor algorithm for various settings of environment.
This program consists of three part: core, utility and application.
Core is core part of the library. Core supports function or APIs of nearest neighbor. Core part is written by C++.
Utility consists of several utility functions to construct core part which can be applied to several other applications. Utility part is written by C++.
Application consists of some algorithms and applications using this library. Application part is written by several different languages.
